How Do I Contribute to a Design?
--------------------------------

Rhombus employs *edited design documents* for each proposed improvement to its design. Depending on the component you'd like to contribute to, there are a few different possibilties.

Contributing to a Live Proposal
-------------------------------

If the component you'd like to contribute to is currently being discussed, then there is going to be a designated editor for the corresponding design document. Discuss your ideas with the group in general and the editor in particular to get a sense of how to contribute. Typically, contributions may take the form of doing a "code review" of the associated pull request for the design document on the main Rhombus repo. Contributing could also involve participating in discussions in relevant channels, or even submitting fresh alternatives as issues on the editor's fork of the repo -- in general, contribute in whatever way you are comfortable with that also works for the editor. As the goal of this stage of the process is to produce a design document showcasing all alternatives, the editor is interested in understanding your point of view -- for your part, ensure that they incorporate your suggestions into the document, and review the inclusion to ensure accuracy. Avoid undertaking any substantial editing of the document itself (e.g. with the plan to do a pull request containing your edits) without first running it by the editor.

Contributing to a Suspended Proposal
------------------------------------

If the component you'd like to contribute to was discussed at some time in the past and is at present dormant, then you have a couple of options. Is this a small improvement or adjustment? If so, consider submitting a pull request with the suggested edits to the design document. If it is a larger scale improvement, then consider bringing it up for discussion at an upcoming Rhombus meeting, and consider volunteering to be editor for this next phase of development that you are proposing.

Contributing a Fresh Proposal
-----------------------------

If the component you'd like to contribute to does not appear to have been discussed, then bring it up for discussion, and consider volunteering to be the editor for the proposal if you'd like to see it through. This isn't required in any way -- if necessary, another project member will take on the editing role, depending on priority and availability. But if you think you can do it, then you may just be the right person for the job.

Attending Meetings
------------------

Coming Prepared
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Anyone is welcome to attend and participate in a Rhombus meeting. If you believe you have value to contribute, then please by all means attend. The Rhombus team would love to hear from you, and there are no pre-requisites to attending. That said, if you are interested in or have an opinion on the issue up for discussion, then it would be greatly appreciated if you could read the work-in-progress document so that you can be prepared with your suggestions in the light of what's currently there, to make the best of everyone's time including your own.
