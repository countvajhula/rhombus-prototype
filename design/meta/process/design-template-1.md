A Relational Model of Data
==========================

Motivation
----------

Future users of large data banks must be protected from having to know how the data is organized in the machine.

Summary
-------

A model based on n-ary relations, a normal form for data base relations, and the concept of a universal data sublanguage are introduced.

Design
------

The design consists of component 1, component 2, and component 3, which interact in such-and-such manner.

### Component 1

Component 1 needs to accomplish a certain goal.

#### Option A

One way to do it is Option A which entails doing it a certain way. This achieves the goal but suffers from problem P.

#### Option B

Another way to do it is Option B which entails doing it a different way. This achieves the goal but entails a tradeoff of F for G.

#### Recommendation

Option B is a tradeoff worth making, since it also has benefits K and L. It may also be possible to leverage a certain aspect of A to mitigate the loss of P that option B entails.

### Component 2

...

### Component 3
