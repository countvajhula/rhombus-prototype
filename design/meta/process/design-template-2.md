Feature Name
==========================

Summary
-------

Brief (e.g. one paragraph) explanation of the feature.

Motivation
----------

Why are we doing this?
What use cases does it support?
What is the expected outcome?

Design Options
--------------

### Option A

Explain the proposal as if it was already included in the
language and you were teaching it to another programmer.
That generally means:

- Introducing new named concepts.
- Explaining the feature largely in terms of examples.
- Explaining how programmers should *think* about the feature.

#### Component 1

Introduce each component's behavior on its own if possible.

#### Component 2

When a component interacts with other components, show
examples with simple cases of the other components first,
before combining them in more complex ways.

...

### Option B

Explain the components that differ from other options.

#### Component 2

When this component interacts with others, include more
examples showing its behavior with other components at the
end.

...

Evaluation and Tradeoffs
--------------

Explain the tradeoffs between the various options.

Prior art and References
---------

Discuss prior art, both the good and the bad, in relation to this proposal.
A few examples of what this can include are:
- Does this feature exist in other programming languages and what experience have their community had?
- Papers: Are there published papers, books, great blog posts, etc that discuss this? Be _specific_!

Drawbacks and Unresolved questions
----------------------------------

- Why should we *not* do this? Could we do something else instead?
- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the PR and discussion process before this gets merged?
- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the implementation of this feature before stabilization?
- What related issues do you consider out of scope for this feature that could be addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out of this design?
