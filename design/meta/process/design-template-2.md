- Feature Name: (fill me in with a unique ident, my_awesome_feature)

# Summary

Brief (e.g. one paragraph) explanation of the feature.

# Motivation

Why are we doing this?
What use cases does it support?
What is the expected outcome?

# Design Options

## Option A

Explain the proposal as if it was already included in the
language and you were teaching it to another programmer.
That generally means:

- Introducing new named concepts.
- Explaining the feature largely in terms of examples.
- Explaining how programmers should *think* about the feature.

### Component 1

Introduce each component's behavior on its own if possible.

### Component 2

When a component must interact with other components, show
examples with simple cases of the other components first,
before combining them in more complex ways.

## Option B

When an option changes multiple components, explain all of
the components, without relying on too much knowledge of
other options.

### Component 1

Write it so that a reader could skip over previous options
and read this one without getting lost.

### Component 2

When components interact, show examples with components
within this option, not other options.

## Option C

When an option changes only a single component of a
previous option, it's only necessary to explain that
component and how it interacts with the other components in
the option it's a modification of.

### Component 2

When this component interacts with others, include more
examples showing its behavior with other components at the
end.

# Preferences and Tradeoffs

Explain your own recommendation between the options.
You may also include other relevant people's preferences here.
Include explanations of the tradeoffs between them.

# Prior art

Discuss prior art, both the good and the bad, in relation to this proposal.
A few examples of what this can include are:

- Does this feature exist in other programming languages and what experience have their community had?
- Papers: Are there published papers, books, great blog posts, etc that discuss this? Be _specific_!


# Drawbacks and Unresolved questions

- Why should we *not* do this? Could we do something else instead?
- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the PR and discussion process before this gets merged?
- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the implementation of this feature before stabilization?
- What related issues do you consider out of scope for this feature that could be addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out of this design?
