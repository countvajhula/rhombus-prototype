A Relational Model of Data
==========================

Motivation
----------

Future users of large data banks must be protected from having to know how the data is organized in the machine.

Summary
-------

A model based on n-ary relations, a normal form for data base relations, and the concept of a universal data sublanguage are introduced.

Design Options
--------------

### Option A

In this approach, the design consists of component 1, component 2, and component 3, which interact in such-and-such manner.

#### Component 1

Component 1 works in the following way.

#### Component 2

Component 2 fits into the picture in this way.

#### Evaluation

This option entails the following tradeoffs.

### Option B

In this approach, the design consists of component 1 and component 2, which interact in such-and-such manner.

...

### Option C

This is just like Option B, except that Component 2 is modified in the following way.

...

Recommendation
--------------

Option B is a tradeoff worth making, since it also has benefits K and L. It may also be possible to leverage a certain aspect of Option A to mitigate the loss of P that option B entails.
