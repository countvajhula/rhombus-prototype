Editor's Guide
==============

I'm an Editor. Now What?
------------------------

Congrats, your fellow team members trust you to see this thing through! Being an editor is a role carrying responsibility and requiring skill. But don't worry, in this document, we'll go over some tips to ensure that you're well-equipped to succeed.

What Are My Obligations?
------------------------

Being an editor is not just a technical role -- it needn't even be a predominantly technical role! There is a significant collaborative component which cannot be addressed purely through procedural means, even if the innovation process is designed to support you in this.

As an editor, your goal is to:

1. Reveal the options that are available.
2. Develop these options to the best versions of themselves.
3. Assess these options in terms of tradeoffs, with any supporting material to substantiate these assessments (e.g. proofs-of-concept to demonstrate or invalidate claims).
4. Present these options in context and make recommendations where possible.
5. Keep the design document up to date.

Although all of this is entailed in the role of editor, it doesn't mean that you have to do everything -- or even anything -- on your own. In fact, fulfilling your duties effectively requires a careful balancing act of innovating while keeping your peers abreast of developments so that they are in a position to contribute, and so that they feel encouraged to do so. The best proposals reflect input from many participants -- whether that's creative input or considered review.

Starting a Proposal
-------------------

Start the discussion somewhere, suggest it for an upcoming meeting. Typically, you would start a design document *after* such a meeting, so that there is an opportunity to agree on a starting point and aims for the proposal.

What Does It Mean for the Document to be "Up to Date"?
------------------------------------------------------

A design document should be kept up to date with all discussions to within one full meeting cycle (e.g. two weeks). But, especially if you plan on discussing the proposal at the next meeting, consider having your document up to date one half meeting cycle (e.g. one week) before the meeting, to allow people time to read it and come prepared.

I Don't Like Option Q. What Should I Do?
----------------------------------------

The role of the design document isn't to propose a particular way of doing things but to showcase different ways of doing something and *make a recommendation from amongst them*. If there is an option available that you aren't convinced by, then include it as one of the options, showcasing its benefits and drawbacks to the best of your ability. If there is another project member partial to this particular option, consider requesting a review of your presentation of this option (or even a pull request), so that they can help you put together an objective representation.

What if I Can No Longer Fulfill My Editing Obligations?
-------------------------------------------------------

That's okay! Your fellow project members appreciate all that you've done, and if it's truly time, then you can abdicate your responsibility to another project member, or just let the group know so that another editor may be nominated to succeed you.
